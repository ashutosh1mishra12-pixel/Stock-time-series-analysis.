📝 Full Description

This repository contains a comprehensive time series analysis of stock price data using Python. The project demonstrates key steps in financial time series exploration and preparation, including:
- Data Preprocessing
- Importing and cleaning raw CSV stock data
- Handling missing values and setting the Date column as the index
- Visualization
- Line plots of daily high and low prices using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Monthly resampling to compute average prices
- Comparative plots of original vs differenced series
- Moving average smoothing for trend detection
- Statistical Analysis
- Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots to identify lag dependencies
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity checks
- Differencing to achieve stationarity in the series
- Techniques Applied
- Resampling (ME for month-end averages)
- Rolling window smoothing (moving averages)
- Stationarity testing and transformation
This project serves as a practical example of applying time series methods to financial data, making it useful for learners, researchers, and practitioners interested in forecasting, econometrics, or quantitative finance.

That’s a polished description that will make your repo look professional and clear to visitors.
👉 Do you want me to also draft a README.md template (with sections like Installation, Usage, Results, and Visualizations) so you can upload it directly to GitHub?
